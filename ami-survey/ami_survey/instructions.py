"""The survey procedure, packaged for whatever runtime is asking.

A Claude Code "skill" is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter that its harness
loads automatically. Other runtimes have no such concept - but the procedure
itself is not Claude-specific, and neither are the tools. So there is one source
of truth (`skills/ami-survey/SKILL.md`) and this module re-packages it:

    instructions(runtime)   the procedure as plain markdown, with the telemetry
                            step adapted to what that runtime can actually measure
    tool_schemas(fmt)       the ami_* tools as OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini function
                            definitions, for agents that are not MCP clients

The honest constraint, stated in the text itself: instructions travel anywhere,
but *telemetry needs an adapter per harness*. A runtime with one (see
`adapters/`) is measured from its own session log and the agent supplies nothing.
A runtime without one must report its own usage via `ami_record_calls`, because
the one thing the survey will not accept is a model's estimate of its own token
count.
