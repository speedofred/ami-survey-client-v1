"""Install the AMI survey skill and MCP server, on any operating system.

    python3 scripts/install.py --user
    python3 scripts/install.py --codex

A published client submits to the hosted survey and has no other destination, so
there is nothing to point it at - it asks for your token and that is all. A
development checkout, which carries the server half, takes `--api-url` to submit
somewhere other than the local API it would otherwise start.

Written in Python rather than shell for one decisive reason: **the interpreter
running this script is the interpreter written into the configuration.** On
Windows that sidesteps the worst trap in the whole setup - `python3` there is
often a Microsoft Store stub that opens the Store instead of running anything,
so a shell script resolving `python3` configures an agent that can never start.

It also means no bash, no symlink permissions, and no POSIX path assumptions,
all of which a Windows install would otherwise trip over.
