"""Thin HTTP client for the survey API.

The MCP server is the only consumer, and there are two shapes of install:

- A **development checkout**, which has the server half on disk. It may point
  anywhere, and autostarts a local API so an agent can take the survey without
  the human remembering to boot one. `AMI_AUTOSTART_API=0` opts out.
- A **published client**, which does not. It submits to the hosted survey and
  refuses everything else: there is no local API for it to start, and a survey
  that never leaves the submitter's disk is not a benchmark anyone can compare.

`config.SERVER_HALF_PRESENT` is the switch. Note what it is not: the published
client is source, and source can be edited. This makes the honest path the only
one that works by configuration, and the *server* is what enforces the rest -
it needs a token, and its half of the code is not published at all.
