"""Workflow discovery, scaffolding and reset.

A benchmark is only comparable if every run starts from the same state, so this
module knows two things: where the workflows live, and what has to be true before
a run begins.

`ami-workflow` manages workflows; `ami-run` is the only thing that runs one. The
split is deliberate - preparing a workflow to paste into Claude Code and spending
money on a provider's API should not be one word apart.

    ami-workflow list                  every workflow found
    ami-workflow new <name>            scaffold a directory
    ami-workflow show <name>           reset it and print the prompts to paste
    ami-workflow show <name> --prompt  just the prompt, for piping
    ami-workflow list --dir PATH       workflows kept somewhere else
